### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Student at Epitech Rennes since 2018.


## Technical profile  

During my first 2 years at Epitech, I was able to work on a lot of projects projects in various fields including:  
- System programming  
- Graphical programming (Sfml, Sdl, Ncurses)  
- Mathematics  
- Algorithmic  
- Object-oriented programming  
These projects were developped in **C**, **C++** and **Python**.  

I decided to specialize in web&mobile development after my various projects and internships in this field.  
I also developped using Unity (2D & 3D) during some Global Game Jams at Epitech.  
It was quite a fun exercise to do and it made me discover game development using **C#**.
